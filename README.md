# Use Case: Propensity to Purchase

This example uses standard python libraries such as sklearn and pandas. 

The data comes from an anonymized Google Analytics dataset that captures customer interactions and behaviors associated with an online purchasing decision.

Note that this example is kept relatively simple and by no means includes all steps you would normally take to ensure a quality machine learning model.
